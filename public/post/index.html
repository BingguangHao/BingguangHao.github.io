        Enhancing Large Language Models&#39; Function Calling via Self-Refinement Multiscale Loss and Automated Data Refinement

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Function call becomes a fundamental concept in Large Language Models, enabling more efficient interaction.</p>
<p>We propose FunReason, FunReason enhances LLMs&rsquo; function calling by balancing reasoning and execution accuracy. Using automated data refinement and Self-Refinement Multiscale Loss (SRML), it generates high-quality training data for query parseability, reasoning coherence, and precise function calls. SRML optimizes both aspects during training, matching GPT-4o performance while minimizing forgetting.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of FunReason&rsquo;s data refinement pipeline.</strong> The pipeline consists of five stages: Function Call Classification, Query and Tool Identification, CoT Identification, Function and Parameter Identification, and Format Identification. Each stage ensures specific aspects of data quality, with failing examples either being discarded or regenerated.</p>

        Chapter VI: Esmeralda

      <p>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of
this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on
by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to
listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined
to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on
the part of the public. This gleam of hope acquired fresh life, when he
saw Quasimodo, Coppenole, and the deafening escort of the pope of the
procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar. The throng rushed
eagerly after them. “Good,” he said to himself, “there go all the
mischief-makers.” Unfortunately, all the mischief-makers constituted the
entire audience. In the twinkling of an eye, the grand hall was empty.</p>

      <p>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion. It was settled that each candidate, man or woman (for it was possible to choose a female pope), should, for the sake of leaving the impression of his grimace fresh and complete, cover his face and remain concealed in the chapel until the moment of his appearance. In less than an instant, the chapel was crowded with competitors, upon whom the door was then closed.</p>
